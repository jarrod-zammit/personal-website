Hi! My name is Jarrod, and I just completed my Honours degree at the University of Sydney. I am currently applying to Masters programs in Theoretical Physics.


## Current Areas of Interest

- Higher symmetries in QFT
- Applications of quantum groups to integrable systems
- String theory


## Snapshot of Me

When I am not studying, you might find me:

- Out for a walk
- Lost in a good book or movie
- Writing my own stories

**Favourite university courses:** Complex Analysis; Algebraic Topology; Commutative Algebra; General Relativity; QFT I & II.

**Least favourite university course:** My first course in Real Analysis. I have since overcome my fear of epsilon's and delta's.
