Hi! My name is Jarrod, and I am in between things right now. Last year I completed my honours degree at the University of Sydney. I am currently investigating European Master's programs in Theoretical Physics for an Autumn 2026 commencement.

When I am not studying maths and physics, you might find me writing fiction, reading fiction, out for a walk, watching a movie, or sleeping.
