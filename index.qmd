Hi! My name is Jarrod, and I just completed my Honours degree at the University of Sydney. I am currently applying to Masters programs in Theoretical Physics.


## Snapshot of Me

My research interests are:

- Higher symmetries in QFT
- Applications of quantum groups to integrable systems
- String theory

When I am not studying, you might find me:

- Out for a walk
- Lost in a book or movie
- Writing my own stories

**Favourite Courses:** Complex Analysis, Algebraic Topology, Commutative Algebra, General Relativity and QFT I & II.

**Least Favourite Course:** My first course in Real Analysis. I have since overcome my fear of epsilon's and delta's.
